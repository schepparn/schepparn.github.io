## Smarter decisions

### Testbädd 
"These shifts democratize the development of cities and upend the traditional roles of governments, businesses, and residents. With governments evolving into solution enablers, businesses becoming more participative, and a growing cadre of citizen co-creators, tomorrow’s smart cities will be more connected, networked, and collaborative."

"Smart City 2.0—as some of the more advanced cities have begun to move beyond mere infrastructure, tapping the wisdom of their residents and visitors."

- Collective intelligence 
"Cities are responding by finding ways to prompt better decision-making, not only by government but by business and residents, tapping into the collective intelligence of the city."

"In one year since it was first launched, Foodborne Chicago helped hundreds of Chicagoans report food poisoning to the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), resulting in 150 restaurant and food service inspections conducted by the city last year - inspections that otherwise may not have happened. Foodborne Chicago is a web application that uses Twitter to identify persons who believe they may have food poisoning, then flags those public tweets with CDPH for possible follow up."

"In the drive to smarter cities, city governments can foster the creation of environments in which ecosystem innovators—including government, businesses, social entrepreneurs, and individuals—can thrive. Governments help build platforms, recruit an ecosystem of partners, hold partners accountable for targeted outcomes, attract new investment, open up services to choice, and manage crowdsourced campaigns and competitions. This requires them to assemble an ecosystem of partners across government, established businesses, start-ups, the academic sector, and the nonprofit world."

"Many innovative projects struggle to get off the ground due to lack of funding. However, cities can address this challenge through creative approaches to fund smart city projects that depart from traditional models of infrastructure finance."

"Public-private partnership (PPP) models will play an important role in smart city financing and funding."

"by co-designing a solution called “Family by Family” with the people they sought to support. Such co-creation approaches allow policy designers to build better prototypes and test them in real-life scenarios, increasing effectiveness."
