- Resident talent

### Testbädd citat
"These shifts democratize the development of cities and upend the traditional roles of governments, businesses, and residents. With governments evolving into solution enablers, businesses becoming more participative, and a growing cadre of citizen co-creators, tomorrow’s smart cities will be more connected, networked, and collaborative."
